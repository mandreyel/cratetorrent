//! This module defines the alerts the API user may receive from the torrent
//! engine.
//!
//! Communication of such alerts is performed via unbounded [tokio mpsc
//! channels](tokio::sync::mpsc). Thus, the application in which the engine is
//! integrated may be driven partially or entirely by cratetorrent alerts.
//!
//! # Optional information
//!
//! By default only the most basic alerts are broadcast from the engine. The
//! reason for this is that cratetorrent follows a philosophy similar what lies
//! behind Rust or C++: pay for only what you use.
//!
//! This is of course not fully possible with something as complex as a torrent
//! engine, but an effort is made to make more expensive operations optional.
//!
//! Such alerts include the [latest downloaded
//! pieces](crate::conf::TorrentAlertConf::completed_pieces) or aggregate
//! statistics about a torrent's [peers](crate::conf::TorrentAlertConf::peers).
//! More will be added later.
